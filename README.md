# Pass-Fail-Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using pure Python and mathematics, without using any machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

The model predicts whether a student Passes or Fails based on the number of study hours, using:

Sigmoid function

Log loss (cross-entropy)

Gradient Descent optimization

This project is ideal for beginners to understand the core mathematics behind Logistic Regression.
